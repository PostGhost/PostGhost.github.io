        <h2>About Us</h2>
          
          <p class="lead">The Post Ghost Production Company, established in 2010, has a wide array of production and mastering expertise. We pride ourselves in offering 'The Whole Package' to our clients. With PGPC you'll gain access to an expert-level engineering team utilising the best of hard and soft technologies to get your mix sounding great.</p>
          
          <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
          <p class="lead">The Post Ghost technique is to enhance the artist/band as they are and wish to be, smoothly, subtly, and professionally. I’m here to give you the best, loudest, clearest, most dynamic masters and leave you satisfied every time.</p>

          <h2>Finished Product Summary</h2>
          <p class="lead">I am happy to send free 30 second samples of your masters so that you can hear what you’re getting before you pay for it. The finished product I send you back will be rich, lively, and commercially acceptable. It’s a great idea for radio play, live shows, and to make your album or EP sound great. I’ll deliver physical discs burnt with your finished album on it, as well as e-mailing you bounced .wav’s for back-up. Track names will be printed and included on the disc and bounces.</p>

          <h2>Education</h2>
          <p class="lead">Associate of Arts Degree in Music and Recording<br>
Madison Media Institute, Madison, Wisconsin<br>
              Degree awarded in January 2010</p>

          <h2>Pricing &amp; Payment Methods</h2>
          <p class="lead">Cash, check, and paypal are all acceptable payment methods.
I charge $25 per song. Intros, interludes, and outros are based on length; items under one minute are free, anything over will be the standard $25 price.</p>

          <h2>Instructions For Delivery</h2>
          <p class="lead">Please send your songs in 32 or 24 bit depth files in .wav, .aif, or .bwf format; this will allow me to give you the best possible sound. 16-bit depth doesn’t have as much data for me to elaborate on, so please let me know if you are having any problems bouncing high resolution files and I will gladly assist you. Please send your songs with an overall output volume of at least -5d; the more headroom is available, the more I will be able to boost your sound and achieve the best results. (If you send your songs to me as loud as you can make them, I won’t have any room for improvement and any potential issues will be harder to repair; this is one of the many import aspects regarding available headroom).</p>

          <p class="lead">To most accurately give you the volume and overall sound you desire, please feel free to send me a song by your favorite artist or favorite album who is on the ideal level you’d like your finish product to be comparable to. Please send this reference track in any format besides mp3, as those are inherently very low resolution. If you would rather not send a reference track, that’s okay too-- it is a completely optional strategy which is not necessary to achieve excellent results.</p>

<h2>I Guarantee</h2>
          <p class="lead">Professional service and quality.<br>
Fast, excellent results.
If you aren’t immediately fully satisfied, I will happily take your feedback, make adjustments, and provide the results you want.</p>
