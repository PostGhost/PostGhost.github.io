          <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
          <p class="lead">The Post Ghost technique is to enhance the artist/band as they are and wish to be, smoothly, subtly, and professionally. I’m here to give you the best, loudest, clearest, most dynamic masters and leave you satisfied every time.</p>

          <h2>Finished Product Summary</h2>
          <p class="lead">I am happy to send free 30 second samples of your masters so that you can hear what you’re getting before you pay for it. The finished product I send you back will be rich, lively, and commercially acceptable. It’s a great idea for radio play, live shows, and to make your album or EP sound great. I’ll deliver physical discs burnt with your finished album on it, as well as e-mailing you bounced .wavs for back-up. Track names will be printed and included on the disc and bounces.</p>
