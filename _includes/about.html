        <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
        <p class="lead">The Post Ghost technique is to enhance the you, the artist, as you are and wish to be, smoothly, subtly, and professionally. I am here to give you the best, loudest, clearest, most dynamic masters and leave you satisfied every time.</p>

        <h3>Your first song is free.</h3>
        <p class="lead">Because I trust you will be completely satisfied with the quality of my work, I offer free mastering of a single track to all new clients. I make this offer as an opportunity to open a working dialogue and a way to prove myself to you. I believe that when you allow me to demonstrate my abilities to you, you will want to continue working with me.</p>

        <h2>Finished Product Summary</h2>
        <p class="lead">Getting your material mastered is essential for radio play, live shows, and to make your album or EP sound great both digitally and in physical formats. The finished product you receive back will be rich, lively, and commercially viable. Once you have approved the masters and I have received your payment, your full tracks will be made downloadable online; a burned CDR can be mailed to you upon request. Track names will be printed and included on the disc and bounces.</p>

        <h2>Pricing &amp; Payment Methods</h2>

        <p class="lead">Cash, check, and PayPal are all acceptable payment methods. My charges vary per song depending on the overall length of your project. Intros, interludes, and outros are based on length. Items under one minute are free.</p>
