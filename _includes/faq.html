          <p class="lead">Please send your songs in 32 or 24 bit depth files in .wav, .aif, or .bwf format; this will allow me to give you the best possible sound. 16-bit depth doesn’t have as much data for me to elaborate on, so please let me know if you are having any problems bouncing high resolution files and I will gladly assist you. Please send your songs with an overall output volume of at least -5d; the more headroom is available, the more I will be able to boost your sound and achieve the best results. (If you send your songs to me as loud as you can make them, I won’t have any room for improvement and any potential issues will be harder to repair; this is one of the many import aspects regarding available headroom).</p>

          <p class="lead">To most accurately give you the volume and overall sound you desire, please feel free to send me a song by your favorite artist or favorite album who is on the ideal level you’d like your finish product to be comparable to. Please send this reference track in any format besides mp3, as those are inherently very low resolution. If you would rather not send a reference track, that’s okay too-- it is a completely optional strategy which is not necessary to achieve excellent results.</p>
